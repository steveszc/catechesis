        <p>It's every Christian's calling to continue learning, growing, and striving to know the truths taught in the Bible. <em>Catechesis</em> — from a Greek word meaning "instruction by mouth"— is a historic teaching method of giving Christians the language with which to articulate the basic tenets of faith — narrowing in on what the Bible says, and what it doesn't say.</p>

        <p>In a question and answer format, catechisms pose an inquiry and then supply a theologically-packed response drawn from Scripture.</p>
